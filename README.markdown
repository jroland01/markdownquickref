# Markdown Quick Reference for Vim

This is a very basic quick reference to Markdown syntax as a Vim help file.

## Installation

1. Move `markdownquickref.txt` to `~/.vim/doc/`
2. In Vim (normal mode), type `:helptags ~/.vim/doc/`

Done.

## Usage

Type `:help markdownquickref` or `:help mdref`. You can also go straight to the section you want if you know the section tag. They are reasonably named, e.g. `:help md-lists`, `:help md-img`, etc.
